# Final Project for MTH 2151 Statistical Modeling

A grade of 100 was recived on this project

Course Description: The fundamental issues and terminology regarding statistical modeling will be studied. A selection of the main techniques for statistical modeling will be investigated including, but not limited to, linear regression, linear discriminant analysis, K nearest neighbors, decision trees, support vector machines and neutral networks. The mathematical justification and statistical properties of each of these methods will be considered. A variety of applications will be addressed and current software will be applied. Each student will complete a semester project.
